### Abstract

Electroencephalography (EEG) has wide-ranging applications, from clinical diagnosis to brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). With the increasing volume and variety of EEG data, there has been growing interest in establishing foundation models (FMs) to scale up and generalize neural decoding. Despite showing early potential, applying FMs to EEG remains challenging due to substantial inter-subject, intertask, and inter-condition variability, as well as diverse electrode configurations across recording setups. To tackle these open challenges, we propose NEURIPT, a foundation model developed for diverse EEG-based Neural Interfaces with a Pre-trained Transformer by capturing both homogeneous and heterogeneous spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in EEG signals. Temporally, we introduce Amplitude-Aware Masked Pretraining (AAMP), masking based on signal amplitude rather than random intervals, to learn robust representations across varying signal intensities beyond local interpolation. Moreover, this temporal representation is enhanced by a Progressive Mixture-of-Experts (PMoE) architecture, where specialized expert subnetworks are progressively introduced at deeper layers, adapting effectively to the diverse temporal characteristics of EEG signals. Spatially, NeurIPT leverages the 3D physical coordinates of electrodes, enabling effective transfer of embedding across varying EEG settings, and develops IntraInter Lobe Pooling (IILP) during fine-tuning to efficiently exploit regional brain features. Empirical evaluations across eight downstream BCI datasets, via finetuning, demonstrated NeurIPT consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its broad applicability and robust generalization. Our work pushes forward the state of FMs in EEG and offers insights into scalable and generalizable neural information processing systems. Our project is available at this https URL.

### 1 Introduction

Electroencephalography (EEG) has been widely adopted as a proxy for brain activity and dynamics, due to its non-invasiveness, portability, and high temporal resolution for real-time monitoring [1]. EEG facilitates investigations into brain function, assists in neurological diagnoses [2], provides objective biomarkers for cognitive and affective states [3], and enables the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) [4]. The growing availability of large-scale EEG datasets (spanning diverse populations, recording configurations, and experimental paradigms) has spurred the development of a wide range of computational approaches, including machine learning and deep learning models (CNN [5], RNN [6], GNN [7], Transformers [8]) for learning representations. However, these models are often tailored to specific tasks and settings, limiting their generalizability and cross-setting applicability. Hence, a paradigm shift is necessary to establish generalizable models that can effectively leverage

EEG signals across diverse setups and settings, including inter-subject variability, differences between healthy and patients, electrode configurations, and variations in cognitive or behavioral tasks.

Recent advances in foundation models (FMs), large-scale neural architectures pre-trained using transformers on diverse and unlabeled datasets through self-supervised learning [9], followed by finetuning on downstream datasets, have demonstrated remarkable success in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). In NLP, models [10] such as Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, GPT, and Llama, pre-trained on massive text corpora, have learned general-purpose representations that transfer effectively to a wide range of downstream tasks [11]. Similarly, pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) [12], Masked Autoencoder (MAE) [13] have become foundational components in modern CV pipelines. These developments highlight the potential of FMs to produce robust, transferable representations of both images and language. Building on this progress, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g., SORA [14]) further extend these capabilities by integrating information across multiple data modalities, such as text, images, and audio. Hence, it is intriguing to investigate FMs’ generalizability to brain signals by developing EEG-based FMs.

Initial efforts to develop foundation models (FMs) for neural decoding showed early promise. BENDR [15] adapted techniques from language modeling to learn compressed representations of raw data signals, enabling the model to generalize across different tasks and datasets. EEG2Vec [16] learned generative-discriminative representations for emotion classification tasks. BIOT [17] addressed the challenges of cross-dataset EEG learning by tokenizing EEG signals into fixed-length segments, accommodating variable-length sequences and mismatched channels. By learning from diverse biosignal datasets, improved performance can be achieved in tasks such as seizure detection. To encode EEG signals into discrete tokens, LaBraM [18] introduced a neural tokenizer with vector-quantized spectrum prediction, facilitating the pretraining of transformers to predict masked segments and enhancing the model’s ability to learn from large-scale EEG data. NeuroLM [19] proposed a universal multi-task foundation model that bridged the gap between language and EEG signals. Treating EEG as a foreign language, NeuroLM adopted a text-aligned neural tokenizer and leveraged large language models (LLMs) to perform multi-task learning across various EEG-

related tasks. EEGPT [20] introduced a dual self-supervised learning approach for feature alignment, capturing spatio-temporal representations in EEG data. This method enhanced the model’s ability to learn robust features that generalized across different tasks and datasets. CBraMod [21] presented a criss-cross transformer architecture designed to model spatial and temporal dependencies separately in EEG signals from diverse datasets, facilitating linear probing for fine-tuning on numerous downstream tasks. These methods provided evidence of the applicability of FMs for EEG.

Despite the encouraging preliminary findings, current foundation model (FM) methods for EEG have largely adopted pretraining strategies from language and time-series domains without accounting for several unique properties of EEG. First, existing positional encodings treat electrode channels as interchangeable and ignore their physical three-dimensional arrangement, losing critical spatial relationships, which can significantly impair transferability. Second, prevalent masked pretraining strategies are typically based on randomly masking contiguous signal segments like BERT [22], unintentionally guiding the model toward local interpolation rather than meaningful global representation learning, as illustrated in Figure 2. Third, conventional neural architectures rely heavily on fully connected layers or global pooling mechanisms when fine-tuned to downstream tasks and thus do not explicitly utilize regional brain features. Finally, due to the diversity and complexity of EEG data patterns, ranging from slow-wave oscillations during sleep to rapid spikes during seizures [23], models must be capable of adaptively capturing heterogeneous temporal dynamics recorded in diverse setups. The diverse spectral patterns are shown in Figure 1. Addressing these challenges is critical to fully realizing the potential of foundation models for EEG.

To address the aforementioned challenges, we introduce NEURIPT, a novel EEG foundation model developed to learn robust and generalizable representations across diverse BCI applications. Our NEURIPT include: (i) 3D-Aligned Spatial Encoding, a flexible positional encoding scheme that integrates the actual three-dimensional coordinates of EEG electrodes, enabling seamless adaptation across varying electrode montages without re-training; (ii) Amplitude-Aware Masked Pretraining (AAMP), a novel masking strategy guided by EEG signal amplitude rather than random intervals, shown in Figure 2, compelling the model to capture underlying EEG patterns with amplitude serves as a proxy for signal energy instead of trivial local interpolations; (iii) Progressive Mixture-of-Experts (PMoE), an architectural innovation wherein the number of specialized subnetworks increases with model depth, effectively accommodating diverse temporal EEG patterns; and (iv) Intra-Inter Lobe Pooling (IILP), a spatial aggregation method that performs hierarchical pooling within and across brain lobes, leveraging distinctive regional brain features for downstream tasks. Empirically, NEURIPT achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across eight diverse EEG benchmarks, including seizure detection, cognitive state decoding, sleep stage classification etc., summarized in Figure 5. Our comprehensive evaluations highlight NEURIPT ’s enhanced scalability, improved robustness to spatial and temporal variations, and progress toward building truly universal EEG representation models. These findings mark an advancement for foundation models in EEG and offer practical insights for future neural interface development.

The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

- 1. We propose NEURIPT, a foundation model developed for EEG-based neural interfaces, designed to learn robust and generalizable representations by capturing the intrinsic spatiotemporal heterogeneity of EEG signals across diverse settings.
- 2. Temporally, we introduce Amplitude-Aware Masked Pretraining (AAMP), which masks segments based on signal amplitude rather than random intervals, enabling the model to learn robust features across varying signal intensities. In addition, we design a Progressive Mixture-of-Experts (PMoE) architecture that adaptively introduces specialized experts at deeper layers to capture diverse temporal dynamics in EEG.
- 3. Spatially, NEURIPT incorporates the 3D physical coordinates of electrodes for embedding, facilitating spatial generalization across datasets with varying sensor montages. During fine-tuning, we introduce Intra-Inter Lobe Pooling (IILP) to explicitly model and leverage region-specific brain activity patterns for downstream tasks.
- 4. We conducted extensive empirical evaluations on eight benchmark BCI datasets. NEURIPT consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating strong generalization and broad applicability across diverse EEG-based tasks.

### 2 Method

The framework of NEURIPT is illustrated in Figure 3. In Section 2.1, we provided the details on how NEURIPT integrates spatial and temporal EEG representations by embedding 3D spatial electrode coordinates and employing Amplitude-Aware Masking to enhance self-supervised learning. Subsequently, Section 2.2 describes our Progressive Mixture-of-Experts architecture to dynamically manage EEG variations, complemented by Intra-Inter Lobe Pooling to effectively capture regional brain features for downstream tasks.

- 2.1 Embedding Spatial Context into Temporal Representations

We pretrain our NEURIPT using self-supervised learning to learn robust representations of EEG signals across diverse setups and settings, without relying on annotations or incorporating any

downstream EEG task data. Specifically, given a set of unannotated EEG dataset D(u) = x(i) Ni=1, where each sample x(i) ∈ RT×D represents multivariate EEG signals with T time steps and D electrode channels.

###### 3D Electrode Embedding This is designed to leverage the three-dimensional spatial relationships among EEG electrodes, which are typically arranged according to the international 10–20 electrode

placement system. Specifically, for the d-th electrode channel positioned at (xd,yd,zd), we encode its three spatial coordinates separately and concatenate them as follows:

PE(ds) = Concat PEx (xd),PEy (yd),PEz (zd) . (1)

Each coordinate embedding uses a sinusoidal function defined as PEα(pos)2j = sin(pos · 10000−2j/d

), where α ∈ {x,y,z} denotes the spatial axes, pos represents the position along the corresponding spatial coordinate, j indexes the embedding dimensions, and dα = dmodel/3 is the dimensionality of the embedding for axis α.

) and PEα(pos)2j+1 = cos(pos · 10000−2j/d

α

α

Building upon pixel-level embeddings in CV [12], we adopt single-point embeddings to preserve temporal details and effectively capture sharp spikes crucial for brain activity analysis. We represent

each EEG sample as a collection of data points x(i) = {x(t,di) | 1 ≤ t ≤ T,1 ≤ d ≤ D}, each point is then embedded with both temporal and spatial information:

s(t,di) = Ex(i) + PE(t) + PE(s). (2) Here, E ∈ Rd

model denotes a learnable linear projection vector, PE(t) represents temporal positional encoding following the sinusoidal formulation from Vaswani et al. [9]. After embedding, the encoder

input is represented as follows:

Senc = s(t,di) t = 1,...,T,d = 1,...,D , (3)

where each vector s(t,di) encapsulates both spatial and temporal features, which are crucial for capturing EEG dynamics in subsequent modeling stages. Both temporal and spatial encodings natively support varying temporal lengths T and spatial dimensions D, enabling seamless adaptation to diverse EEG electrode placement systems, such as the 10-05 and 10-20 standards, without additional convolutional components or padding as used in EEGPT [20] and CBraMod [21]. This design is also naturally consistent with the proposed AAMP method introduced below.

Amplitude-Aware Masked Pretraining (AAMP) Self-supervised learning techniques like BERT [22] and MAE [13], which reconstruct randomly masked data, have shown promising results in multivariate time series (MTS) [15, 18, 20]. However, random masking often degrades to simple interpolation between unmasked points in time series data [24], thereby limiting the extraction of meaningful structural representations. To address this, we propose a novel Amplitude-Aware Masking Pretraining (AAMP) approach, explicitly designed to capture more informative features while avoiding mere interpolation, illustrated in Figure 2. After obtaining the embedding array S, we generate our Amplitude-Aware Masking:

M = x(t,di) ∈ [Ld,Ud] | t = 1,...,T,d = 1,...,D , (4)

where the interval [Ld,Ud] covers T · P points, centered around the ξd(i) · T-th point in sorted x(di) . Specifically, probability P denotes the masking ratio and ξd(i) ∼ U(0,1) is a randomly sampled percentile for dimension d of data instance i. Subsequently, we derive the EEG embedding S, partitioned into the masked set SM = {st,d|mt,d = 1} and the unmasked set SU = {st,d|mt,d = 0} according to the corresponding st,d and mt,d.

Hierarchical Attention Modules In complex MTS tasks, i.e., EEG signals processing, capturing both temporal and spatial dimensions is significant [21, 25]. To effectively extract these spatiotemporal characteristics at multiple granularities, we adopt Crossformer [26] as part of our backbone architecture, which hierarchically captures alternating temporal and spatial dependencies by using TSA module. Further implementation details of our modified Crossformer are provided in Appendix C.1.

Specifically, our hierarchical attention model comprises an encoder ENCθ

and a decoder DECθ

,

D

each equipped with trainable parameters θE and θD, respectively. These components jointly capture spatio-temporal relationships and reconstruct masked portions of the input data as follows:

(Senc),Sdec , (5) and the decoder input Sdec is formulated as:

xˆ = DECθ

ENCθ

e

d

Sdec = E (1 − M) ⊙ x(i) + PE(tt) + PE(ds). (6)

The encoder ENCθ

processes the unmasked input SU to extract meaningful features while setting the attention scores of the masked set SM to zero, thereby preventing unintended access to masked tokens. Thereafter, the decoder DECθ

e

reconstructs the signals in Sdec through a specific [mask] token, leveraging both the encoder outputs and unmasked signals enriched by comprehensive positional information. We then optimize the parameters θE and θD by minimizing the ℓp-norm reconstruction loss:

###### 2.2 Integrating Temporal Dynamics into Spatial Representations

EEG signals exhibit complex, heterogeneous information across various frequency bands, transient events, and even inevitable artifacts, making their representations challenging for a single feedforward network (FFN). To address this, we leverage a Progressive Mixture-of-Experts (PMoE) architecture, enabling distinct sub-networks as specialized experts to capture specific EEG features, combined with a shared expert to ensure stable generalization. Subsequently, we fine-tune with Intra-Inter Lobe Pooling (IILP), which effectively captures cross-channel connectivity patterns.

###### Progressive Mixture-of-Experts (PMoE) Given Zˆl ∈ RT×D×d

model, the output after the attention layer and subsequent layer normalization, a gating mechanism computes token-level routing weights:

El

gl = TopKSoftmax(Router(l)(Zˆl)),

gel = 1, (8)

e=1

where El denotes number of experts at the l-th encoder layer and each expert e applies its private sub-network Yel = FFN(el)(Zˆl). Introduced by [27], TopKSoftmax applies the softmax function exclusively to the top-k logits, representing the sparse activation that serves to save computation. These representations are aggregated through gating weights g and further produced the output of transformer block l:

El

gel ⊙ Yel + FFN(sharedl) (Zˆl), (9)

PMoE(l)(Zˆl) =

e=1

Zl = PMoE(l)(Zˆl) + Z˜l, (10)

where ⊙ denotes element-wise multiplication, FFNshared denotes the shared expert, and Z˜l denotes the residual connection from the attention output. Then we incorporate an auxiliary loss Laux to encourage balanced expert utilization and robust routing behavior [27]. Please refer to Appendix C.1 and C.3 for more details about specific architecture and MoE, respectively.

The shared expert captures generalizable patterns, while the progressively introduced experts handle increasingly specialized signal features [28], effectively adapting to the inherent complexity and variability of EEG signals.

Finetuning with Intra-Inter Lobe Pooling (IILP) Following the pretraining phase, we performed fine-tuning using downstream labeled datasets D(l) = x(j),y(j) nj=1 comprising n instances. Each instance x(j) ∈ RT×D is associated with a class label y(j) ∈ C := {1,...,C}, indicating the downstream classification category.

To better capture EEG functional connectivity patterns while suppressing redundant information across channels, we propose IILP, a two-step pooling strategy, Intra-lobe Pooling followed by Interlobe Concatenation, illustrated in Figure 4. Given an encoder block output Zenc,l∈RT×D×d

model,

where T, D, and dmodel denote the temporal length, number of EEG channels, and embedding dimension, respectively.

We first average-pool Zenc along the temporal axis to aggregate information from all time steps:

Vdl =

T

Zenc,lt,d , d = 1,...,D. (11)

t=1

Intra-lobe Pooling. We partition EEG channels into n functional brain lobes, such as frontal and occipital lobes, denoted as P = {P1,...,Pn}. To suppress redundancy within each channel group P, we compute lobe-level embeddings by averaging corresponding channel embeddings:

1 |Pk| d∈P

Vkl =

Vdl , k = 1,...,n. (12)

k

Inter-lobe Concatenation. To leverage discriminative features across different brain lobes, we concatenate the lobe embeddings into a joint representation:

vl = concat V1l,...,Vnl , (13) where vl ∈ Rnd

model indicates the aggregation vector for encoder block l. Repeating the above IILP process across all encoder blocks and stacking the results yields the final representation:

v = concat v1,...,vL , (14)

where L is the number of encoder blocks. Finally, we use a multilayer perceptron as the classifier on the representation obtained at different granularities to predict the task-specific class from the set C.

### 3 Experiments

###### 3.1 Pre-training

Datasets NEURIPT is pre-trained using more than 2,000 hours of data collected from public datasets, with the eight downstream datasets explicitly excluded. For more details on pre-training datasets, please refer to Appendix E.1.

Preprocessing To ensure a fair comparison, we follow the data pre-processing pipeline in CBraMod [21]. EEG recordings with a total duration less than 5 minutes were removed, and we discarded the first and last minute of each remaining session to mitigate boundary artifacts. Signals were re-referenced using 20 bipolar channels in the canonical "double banana" montage (e.g., FP1–F7, F7–T3, ..., P4–O2). For further details on preprocessing, please refer to Appendix E.1.2.

Settings We implemented NEURIPT using Python 3.9.19 and PyTorch 2.3.0 with CUDA 12.1 and cuDNN 8902. Pre-training stage was trained using the AdamW optimizer combined with the OneCycle learning rate strategy [29] (upper learning rate 3e-4, divided factor 25, final divided factor 1e4, and cosine annealing strategy). The pre-training process was conducted for approximately 400K steps, employing an effective batch size of 480 and bfloat16 mixed-precision training on eight NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPUs. For more details on implementation settings and hyperparameters, please refer to Appendix D and Table 13.

###### 3.3 Main Results

We present a comparative analysis of our method against baselines across eight downstream datasets in Table 2, with the best results highlighted in bold. Moreover, we report the performance difference between our method and the best-performing baseline. Compared to the baselines, our method generally outperforms them on the majority of datasets, with the exception of Cohen’s Kappa and AUROC metrics on TUAB. Notably, our method achieves significant improvements on the Mental Arithmetic, PhysioP300, and BCIC-IV-2A datasets. While the performance gains are smaller on other datasets, they remain consistent, demonstrating the robustness and general applicability of our approach. Extensive empirical evaluations on eight benchmark BCI datasets consistently demonstrate strong generalization and broad applicability across diverse EEG-based tasks. Appendix E.2 gives the specific experimental results on each task, including experimental configuration and results analysis.

###### 3.4 Additional Results and Analysis

Analysis of Spatial Relationships between EEG Channels To analyze spatial relationships, we presented in Figure 4 the attention scores from a spatial attention head, along with an analysis of the Pearson correlation between class logits and channel perturbations using Gaussian multiplicative noise. The attention score visualization reveals both inter- and intra-lobe interactions, which aligns with the strengths of IILP. From the perturbation analysis, we observe contralateral activation patterns in channels C3 and C4 for hand-related tasks, and a more symmetrical pattern for foot and tongue movements, in line with findings from the existing study [30]. Refer to Figure 8 and 16 in Appendix G for more visualization about the attention score and Pearson correlation in various datasets.

Analysis of Progressive Mixture-of-Experts (PMoE) We analyzed how temporal and spatial experts in the PMoE architecture contribute to the prediction of the four classes in the BCIC-IV-2A dataset, with the statistics presented in Figure 6. It is observed that different classes engage varying numbers of experts, with some classes receiving attention from a larger number of experts. Refer to Figure 9-15 in Appendix G for more expert contributions across different datasets.

Ablation of MoE Strategies and PMoE Configurations Tables 3 and 4 show the ablation results of MoE strategies and PMoE configurations, respectively. When varying the number of experts across layers, our PMoE, which increases the number of experts with depth, consistently outperforms both the non-MoE baseline, the uniform-expert variant, and the shrinking MoE variant, where the number of experts decreases with depth. The alternative configs in Table 4 also yield competitive performance, which suggests that the effectiveness of the PMoE approach stems from its inherent progressive strategy, rather than relying on any specific expert allocation, demonstrating robustness across diverse progressive configurations.

Ablation of Pooling Strategies We compared our Intra-Inter Lobe Pooling (IILP) with no pooling as well as pooling strategies based on coronal, sagittal, and hemispheric brain region groupings. The results are presented in Table 5, demonstrating the consistent effectiveness and superiority of IILP.

Ablation of Each Individual Component The ablation in Table 6 demonstrates that performance across datasets generally improves with the inclusion of each component, achieving peak accuracy when all components are combined. Notably, the IILP module significantly enhances results on the TUEV and Mumtaz2016 datasets. This improvement is presumably because epilepsy and depression classification tasks require capturing distinctive regional signal variations across different brain areas.

For BCIC-IV-2A, which primarily involves motor imagery tasks and was recorded using EEG channels located centrally with limited coverage of other brain lobes, we observed a performance decline when the 3D PE component was excluded. This suggests that motor imagery tasks are particularly sensitive to spatial information, as further supported by our channel perturbation analysis in Figure 4. Given the low-data scenario (BCIC-IV-2A includes only nine subjects), explicitly encoding physical spatial relationships becomes especially important. Moreover, excluding only IILP may degrade performance due to incomplete brain lobe coverage, limiting the model’s utilization of lobe-specific information, yet incorporating it during pretraining enhances generalization (see Table 5).

Nonetheless, SwiGLU demonstrated the most consistent performance across multiple downstream tasks, indicating its robustness in FMs for EEG data.

### 4 Conclusion

This study introduces NEURIPT, a foundation model established for diverse EEG-based neural interfaces, overcoming the challenges in learning generalizable spatio-temporal representations of EEG signals from diverse sources. Temporally, we propose Amplitude-Aware Masked Pretraining (AAMP), which selects masked segments based on signal amplitude rather than random intervals, encouraging the model to capture robust features across varying signal intensities and avoiding reliance on local interpolation. This is complemented by a Progressive Mixture-of-Experts (PMoE) architecture, which progressively incorporates specialized expert subnetworks at deeper layers to better adapt to the temporal variability inherent in EEG data. Spatially, NEURIPT utilizes the 3D physical coordinates of electrodes to support transferable embeddings across different EEG configurations and introduces Intra-Inter Lobe Pooling (IILP) during fine-tuning to effectively leverage region-specific brain activity. Comprehensive evaluations on eight benchmark EEG datasets demonstrate NEURIPT ’s consistent state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization. These findings highlight NEURIPT’s potential as a scalable foundation model for EEG, moving toward universal neural decoding systems.

### A Related Work

Existing literature on EEG-based neural decoding can be broadly categorized according to the evolution from EEG setting-specific models to generalizable foundation models, as outlined below:

###### A.1 Decoding EEG Signals with Task- and Setup-Specific Models

EEG decoding has evolved from classical BCI pipelines, that develop computational approaches based on the well-known EEG signatures (e.g., P300, event-related (de)synchronization, Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP), etc [31]) to feature engineering and statistical classifiers such as, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), or support vector (SVM), random forest, common spatial pattern (CSP) [5, 32], to more sophisticated machine learning and deep learning models tailored for specific tasks and recording setups. These models are often trained on specific datasets and optimized for particular paradigms, such as motor imagery [32], gait recognition [5], emotion recognition [33], and seizure detection [7], under fixed channel layouts, devices, or recording conditions, building upon prior knowledge of EEG characteristics. Deep learning approaches such as CNN [5], RNN [6], GNN [7], Transformers [8], and their hybrids have been widely applied to model EEG’s complex spatiotemporal dynamics using spectrogram, time-frequency representation, and brain connectivity [34].

Recent work has shifted end-to-end learning paradigms that learn representations directly on raw EEG signals [35, 36, 37], reducing the dependence on handcrafted preprocessing. However, these methods still struggle with generalization across subjects, devices, or experimental conditions and require retraining when used in different settings.

###### A.2 Unified EEG Signal Decoding with Pretrained Foundation Models

Motivated by the success of foundation models in natural language processing (NLP) [9, 10], recent trends in EEG research focus on developing large-scale, pretrained neural architectures that scale up and generalize across diverse EEG tasks, conditions, experimental setups, and subjects. These models are typically pre-trained using self-supervised learning on unlabeled EEG data from varied sources, enabling the extraction of task and subject-invariant representations that can be fine-tuned for a wide range of downstream EEG applications. Broadly, three main lines of approaches have emerged: (i) modeling EEG as a multivariate time series using transformer-based architectures adapted from the speech or time-series domains, such as BENDR [15] and EEG2Vec [16]; (ii) tokenizing continuous EEG signals into discrete tokens to enable large-scale pretraining analogous to language modeling, as in LaBraM [18] and NeuroLM [19]; and (iii) preserving EEG’s spatiotemporal structure using specialized architectures that consider both between EEG channels and temporal dynamics from diverse datasets through neural architectural design, exemplified by recent EEG-based FMs, BIOT [17], EEGPT [20], and CBraMod [21]. These FMs reduce the need for task-specific calibration and enhance robustness and scalability in real-world BCI and EEG-based applications. CHARM [38] addressed inconsistent input channels through a learnable channel-level masking approach, and COLA [39] employed contrastive learning rather than masking-based self-supervised pretraining on large-scale audio data. These related works offer valuable complementary perspectives on enhancing EEG modeling.

While these pioneering FMs showed early promise, a few important EEG characteristics are not considered in the current FMs, such as the physical three-dimensional arrangement of electrodes, diverse EEG patterns and intensity across diverse datasets, and brain regional features are not fully taken into account. Moreover, recent successes of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) [40, 41] based foundation models have demonstrated impressive scalability and generalization in fields like LLMs, by designing a larger network (for more parameters) with sub-networks that are only activated by relevant task (for less computation); however, their application and potential benefits remain largely unexplored in EEG decoding. This work attempts to fill the research gap for developing a robust EEG-based FM.

### B Additional Results and Analysis

This section continues from Section 3.4 of the main text and provides further results and analysis. Table 8: Comparison between different masking strategies (masking ratio: 50%).

Masking Strategy Bal. Acc. BERT-style random masking 0.6320

Amplitude-aware masking 0.6845

Ablation of Masking Strategies We compare and analyze our proposed amplitude-aware masking pretraining (AAMP) strategy with BERT-style random masking in Table 8. We directly evaluate the pretrained representations by performing a downstream classification task using Support Vector Machine (SVM)2, aiming to assess the quality of the learned representations obtained during the pretraining stage.3 Our amplitude-based masking improves 5.25% compared to random masking, proving the effectiveness of masking based on amplitude. Figure 7 illustrates the training loss between to strategies. After 1000 steps, random masking has lower reconstruction loss, demonstrating that random masking is better for learning reconstruction. This implies that the model is better at interpolation under random masking, but ultimately performs poorly in downstream classification tasks. Refer to Figure 18, 19 and 20 of Appendix G for more visualization comparisons.

- 2For the classification task in Appendix B, we selected the TUEV due to its complexity and variety, consisting of six distinct classes. To manage the computational complexity of SVM, which scales quadratically with the number of data points, we randomly sampled 5000 data points from the training set and 500 data points from the test set, using a fixed random seed (520) to ensure reproducibility. Hyperparameters were optimized via grid search with 5-fold cross-validation on the sampled training data, and the best-performing combination was subsequently evaluated on the test set. Detailed ranges of hyperparameters explored during the grid search are presented in Appendix D.1 and Table 14.
- 3We use smaller models for quick tests. Specifically, we set dmodel to 256, expert hidden FFNexpert to 128, shared expert hidden FFNshared to 256. The rest of the parameters remain the same as the original pre-trained model.

Low Data Scenario The performance of NEURIPT under low-resource scenarios is presented in Table 12. Our approach achieved notable classification accuracy, maintaining performance in the range of 80% −90% with merely 10% of the original data, and even with an extremely limited 1% of data, performance remains competitive at 64%−80%. These results further confirm the robustness of our pretraining strategy and underscore the model’s potential in few-shot and low-resource settings.

For the ablation studies in Table 6 and 7 in Section 3.4, due to time and resource constraints, the results presented are based on models trained from scratch, without the time-intensive pre-training stage.

### C Additional Methodological Details

###### C.1 Backbone Architecture

We adopt Crossformer [26] as our backbone architecture, which leverages the TSA (Two-stage attention, including cross-time attention and cross-dimension attention) module to hierarchically capture alternating temporal and spatial dependencies. Additionally, the hierarchical structure of TSA, especially at deeper layers with coarser granularity, significantly reduces sequence lengths and computational demands, enabling efficient resource utilization during large-scale pre-training. Furthermore, we replace the Post-LN with Pre-LN [42] and switch the activation function from GELU [43] to SwiGLU [44] for a more stable training process, aligning with mainstream large language models such as the Llama [45, 46], Qwen [41, 47, 48], and Deepseek [40, 49] series. The mathematical formulation of our modified backbone is as follows:

###### Temporal Stage After embedding, Senc ∈ RT×D×d

model is the encoder block ENC’s input, where T and D are the number of time steps and electrode channels, respectively. Consistent with Section 2.2, Zl−1 is the output of the layer l − 1 and Z¯l is the input of the layer l after merging. Thus at the first layer, Z0 = Senc. For convenience, in the following, we use Zi,: to denote the vectors of all dimensions at time step i, Z:,d for those of all time steps in dimension d. In the temporal stage, we directly apply multi-head self-attention MSA to each dimension:

Zˇtime,l = LayerNorm Z ¯l−1 (15) Zˆtime,l:,d = LayerNorm Z ¯l−1 + MSA Z ˇtime,l:,d ,Zˇtime,l:,d ,Zˇtime,l:,d (16) Ztime,l = PMoE(1l) Z ˆtime,l:,d + Z˜time,l:,d (17)

where 1 ≤ d ≤ D and LayerNorm denotes pre-layer normalization [42], MSA(Q,K,V) denotes the multi-head self-attention layer [9] where Q,K,V serve as queries, keys and values, PMoE denotes the

Progressive Mixture-of-Experts introduced in Section 2.2, and Z˜time,l:,d denotes the residual connection result from Equation 16 but without LayerNorm. All dimensions (1 ≤ d ≤ D) share the same MSA layer. Ztime,l denotes the output of the cross-time stage.

Spatial Stage Similarly to the temporal stage, we also apply the above architecture to each time step: Zˇdim,l = LayerNorm Ztime,l (18) Zˆdim,li,: = LayerNorm Ztime,l + MSA Z ˇdim,li,: ,Zˇdim,li,: ,Zˇdim,li,: (19)

Zl = PMoE(2l) Z ˆdim,l:,d + Z˜dim,l:,d (20)

where 1 ≤ i ≤ T and Z˜dim,l:,d denotes the residual connection result from Equation 19 but without LayerNorm. Finally, Zl is the output of the entire TSA layer l. Notably, in practice, at the first layer, we split Equation 2 into the following two parts to embed the temporal and spatial information separately:

Zˇtime,1 = LayerNorm Z0 + PE(t) (21) Zˇdim,1 = LayerNorm Ztime,1 + PE(s) (22)

Equations 21, 22 correspond to Equations 15, 18, respectively, and represent special cases at the first layer. Here, multi-head self-attention MSA is implemented through FlashAttention-2 by [50] to achieve faster speeds.

Hierarchical Attention Modules In each encoder layer (except the first layer), every adjacent ml vectors are merged to produce representations at progressively coarser temporal scales. Then, a TSA layer captures dependencies at this new scale. Formally, the encoder process ENC for layer l is defined as:

 

l = 1 : Z¯enc,0 = Zenc,0, l > 1 : Z¯enc,li,d = M Zenc,l(i−1)m

(23)

l+1,d · Zenc,l(i−1)m

l+2,d · ··· · Zenc,lim



l,d ,

where 1 ≤ i ≤ T

ml , 1 ≤ d ≤ D, Zenc,l denotes the output of the l-th encoder layer, M ∈ Rd

l−1

model×mldmodel is a learnable matrix for dynamic segment merging, "·" denotes the concatenation

operation, Tl−1 denotes the number of segments in layer l − 1, and if not divisible by ml, padding is applied to Zenc,l−1 accordingly.

###### C.2 Additional Masking Strategy

Besides Amplitude-Aware Masking Pretraining (AAMP), we incorporate an additional basic masking strategy proposed in BERT [22]: 80% of the selected tokens are replaced with the [mask] token, 10% are replaced with a randomly sampled embedding from a predefined set S to mitigate overfitting, and the remaining 10% are left unchanged to prevent the model from overly relying on the [mask] token.

###### C.3 Mixture-of-Experts

We incorporate an auxiliary loss consisting of an importance loss L(importancel) and a load-balancing loss L(balancel) of layer l proposed by Google Brain [27]. This auxiliary loss promotes equitable expert allocation, improving model efficiency and generalization:

Laux =

L

L(importancel) + L(balancel) . (24)

l=1

###### C.4 Balanced Binary Cross Entropy

We applied Bal-BCE [51], a logit-adjusted balanced binary cross-entropy loss that has achieved promising results in long-tailed image datasets. Here, we explore similar approaches for imbalanced BCI downstream datasets. Let πy

/N represent the class distribution for yi, where the bias term of the logit zy

= ny

i

i

is given by Bybcei = log πy

). Based on this logit bias adjustment, the loss function we adopt during the fine-tuning stage is as follows:

i − log(1 − πy

i

i

+ Bybcei + (1 − (y i)) · log 1 − σ zy

+ Bybcei ,

LBal-BCE = −

wi (y i) · log σ zy

yi∈C

(25) where is 1 if the condition is true and σ(x) = 1/(1 + e −x) indicates the sigmoid operation.

Hyperparameters of pre-training are reported in Table 13, while Table 14 presents the parameters we used in SVM grid search discussed in Appendix B. For complete details of the settings used on downstream datasets, please refer to Appendix E.2. During fine-tuning, we conducted a grid search over the hyperparameters within the ranges specified in Table 15. Owing to the inherent variability and heterogeneity of EEG datasets, we observed that, for certain datasets, reinitializing model weights was essential for NEURIPT to effectively adapt and fine-tune to downstream tasks (i.e., SEED-V, and BCIC-IV-2A). This behavior is likely attributed to a representational mismatch between the pretrained model’s and the target task. To address this issue, we performed reinitialization when validation performance showed early saturation during fine-tuning. By resetting the model parameters, this enables the network to escape suboptimal representational basins. Benefiting from distributed data parallelism and FlashAttention-2 [50], the entire pre-training procedure was completed within 30 hours. The subsequent fine-tuning on downstream tasks typically required only a few minutes to several hours, depending on the scale of the specific datasets involved.

###### D.2 Baselines and Metrics

Baselines We compare NEURIPT against eight non-foundation methods— BENDR [15], EEGNet [52], EEGConformer [53], SPaRCNet [54], ContraWR [23], CNN-Transformer [55], FFCL [6], and ST-Transformer [8] —and five foundational model baselines: BIOT [17], LaBraM [18], EEGPT [20], NeuroLM [19], and CBraMod [21]. For any model without published downstream results, we directly followed the results reported in CBraMod [21] and EEGPT [20]. Strictly following the settings of CBraMod, we fine-tune BIOT and LaBraM based on their open-source code and pre-trained weights, unless their experimental results have already been reported in the original papers. Table 16 demonstrates the number of activated parameters for different baselines.

Metrics For binary classification tasks, we report Balanced Accuracy, Area Under the Precision–Recall Curve (AUC-PR), and Area Under the ROC curve (AUROC). For multi-class tasks, we use Balanced Accuracy, Cohen’s Kappa, and Weighted F1 score. Note that for PhysioP300, we replace AUC-PR with Cohen’s Kappa to match the evaluation protocol of our EEGPT baseline [20]. More details about the metrics we used:

- • Balanced Accuracy: the average recall across all classes, mitigating class imbalance;
- • AUC-PR: the area under the precision-recall curve;
- • AUROC: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve;
- • Cohen’s Kappa: a measure of inter-rater agreement that accounts for chance, computed based on observed versus expected agreement in a confusion matrix;
- • Weighted F1 Score: the harmonic mean of precision and recall, weighted by class frequency.

###### E.1.2 Preprocessing of Pre-training Datasets

In preprocessing, a 0.1–30 Hz band-pass filter was applied to suppress low- and high-frequency noise, followed by a notch filter to eliminate powerline interference. Data were resampled to 64 Hz and segmented into non-overlapping 4-second windows.

To further improve data quality, we removed samples with any signal exceeding 100 µV in absolute amplitude, or with values consistently below 3 µV or above 3 µV across all time points in any channel, as these likely reflect artifacts or flatlining. Subsequently, data were normalized using A-law companding (from digital signal processing) with A = 0.25 was used to adjust the dynamic range all EEG signals to ensure consistent scaling. After pre-processing, we retained 2,219,455 EEG segments, totaling over 2,100 hours of clean data for pre-training.

Each row and column of a standard 6x6 character matrix was randomly augmented for 100 ms at 50 ms intervals with approximately 20 flashes. During this time, subjects need to focus on the target and count the number of times the target was highlighted. When the target was highlighted, we labeled it as "Target". Otherwise, we label it as "Non-target". We present the analysis of expert participation on this dataset in Figure 12. The channel relationships are visualized in Figure 8.

EEG signals were recorded using a 62-channel ESI NeuroScan system at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. The dataset provides both raw EEG data and extracted differential entropy (DE) features across five frequency bands, facilitating various analyses in emotion recognition research. We also present the analysis of expert participation on the this dataset in Figure 14, and report the Pearson correlation between class logits and channel perturbations induced by Gaussian multiplicative noise in Figure 16. The channel relationships are visualized in Figure 8.

Preprocessing EEG signals were band-pass filtered between 0.1 Hz and 30 Hz and downsampled to 64 Hz. A 50 Hz notch filter was applied to remove power line interference. Each trial was segmented into non-overlapping 1-second epochs, resulting in a total of 115,001 samples. Following CBraMod [21], data from subjects 1–10 were used for training, while subjects 11–15 were reserved for testing. Detailed results are reported in Table 22.

Experimental Configuration Each 1-second segment was treated as an independent sample labeled according to the corresponding emotion category. The model was trained for 10 epochs using a batch size of 256. We use both bipolar and non-bipolar methods, and the non-bipolar one is slightly better than the bipolar one.

Results Our proposed NEURIPT model achieves state-of-the-art performance on SEED-V emotion recognition task, outperforming existing models across the evaluation metrics. These results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of our approach in modeling complex emotional dynamics from EEG signals.

###### E.2.7 Motor Imagery Task: BCIC-IV-2A (4-class)

The BCIC-IV-2A dataset [4] comprises EEG recordings from 9 healthy subjects performing 4 motorimagery tasks: left hand (Class 1), right hand (Class 2), feet (Class 3) and tongue (Class 4). Each subject completed two sessions on separate days; each session contains six runs of 48 trials (12 trials per class), yielding 288 trials per session. Signals were acquired at 250 Hz from 22 channels positioned according to the international 10–20 system and band-pass filtered between 0.5 Hz and 100 Hz. We also present the analysis of expert participation on the this dataset in Figure 6, and report the Pearson correlation between class logits and channel perturbations induced by Gaussian multiplicative noise in Figure 4. The channel relationships are visualized in Figure 8.

Preprocessing Raw EEG signals were band-pass filtered between 0.1 Hz and 30 Hz, followed by downsampling to 64 Hz. For each trial, we extracted the segment from 2 s to 6 s after cue onset and assigned labels according to the instructed motor imagery class. This procedure yielded 288 non-overlapping 4 s segments per session. Signals were re-referenced using 16 predefined bipolar channel pairs. The model input comprised the 16 bipolar channels. Following CBraMod [21], data from subjects 1–5 were used for training, subjects 6–7 for validation, and subjects 8–9 for testing. The detailed channel configuration and corresponding sample counts are provided in Table 23.

Experimental Configuration Optimization employed a cosine-annealed learning rate schedule, warming up linearly from 1.7 × 10−5 to 3.5 × 10−5, then decaying back to 1.7 × 10−5 by epoch 150. We trained with a batch size of 16 for 150 epochs.

Results Our proposed NEURIPT model achieves state-of-the-art performance on BCIC-IV-2A motor imagery classification, outperforming existing baselines across all evaluation metrics. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.

###### E.2.8 Abnormal Detection: TUAB (2-class) and Event Type Classification: TUEV (6-class)

The TUEV dataset [2] is a curated subset of the Temple University Hospital EEG Corpus (TUEG), enriched with expert annotations for epileptiform and non-epileptiform events. Each EEG segment is labeled into one of six categories: spikes and sharp waves (Class 1), generalized periodic epileptiform discharges (Class 2), periodic unilateral epileptiform discharges (Class 3), eye movements (Class 4), artifacts (Class 5), and background (Class 6). Recordings were acquired using 23 EEG channels with a sampling rate of 250 Hz. We present the analysis of expert participation on this dataset in Figure 15. The channel relationships are visualized in Figure 8.

The TUAB dataset [2] is a large-scale EEG corpus annotated for abnormality detection. Each recording is labeled as either normal or abnormal based on clinical reports. Similar to TUEV, the EEG signals were recorded using 23 channels with a sampling rate of 250 Hz. The dataset serves as a benchmark for evaluating automated EEG abnormality detection methods. We present the analysis of expert participation on this dataset in Figure 9. The channel relationships are visualized in Figure 8.

Preprocessing All EEG recordings were band-pass filtered between 0.1 Hz and 30 Hz to attenuate low- and high-frequency noise, and a 60 Hz notch filter was applied to remove power-line interference. Signals were then resampled to 64 Hz and segmented into fixed-length epochs: 5 s non-overlapping segments for TUEV, and 10 s segments for TUAB. We maintained the original training/test partitions provided by each dataset to ensure a fair comparison with the three baselines-LaBraM[18], EEGPT [20] and CBraMod[21]. The training subjects were further divided into training and validation subsets in an 80% / 20% ratio.

Experimental Configuration For TUEV, each 5-second segment was treated as an independent sample labeled according to the corresponding category. The model was trained for 20 epochs using a batch size of 16. The learning rate peaked at 1 × 10−5, and then gradually decayed to a minimum of 1 × 10−7. For TUAB, each 10-second segment was treated as an independent sample labeled according to the corresponding category. The model was trained for 10 epochs using a batch size of

- 16. The learning rate peaked at 5 × 10−6, and then gradually decayed to a minimum of 3 × 10−7.

Results Our proposed NEURIPT model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the TUEV dataset, consistently outperforming existing baselines across all evaluation metrics. These results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of our method. On the TUAB abnormality detection task, NEURIPT attains higher balanced accuracy compared to prior methods. While the performance on the other two metrics is slightly lower than the best results, it still exceeds most baseline models. This indicates that NEURIPT is both competitive and effective, demonstrating strong generalization ability in learning transferable EEG representations.

### F Discussion

- F.1 Limitation

While NEURIPT incorporated several important characteristics of EEG signals into its neural architecture to learn more generalizable representations, there remain several open challenges and opportunities for future work. (1) For instance, additional EEG-specific aspects, such as brain connectivity representations, have not yet been fully explored and could enhance decoding performance. (2) Moreover, as with many foundation models, NEURIPT requires a large number of parameters, resulting in increased memory usage and higher computational costs during both training and inference compared to non-foundation models. (3) Our ability to further scale the model and investigate scaling laws was constrained by the limited GPU resources available. (4) Lastly, although NEURIPT achieved SOTA performance on average across multiple datasets, there is still room to improve neural decoding accuracy to fully meet the practical demands of BCI systems for real-world and clinical applications.

- F.2 Broader Impacts

This work advances neural decoding for general EEG-based neural interfaces, with potential benefits across a wide range of BCI applications, including clinical diagnosis, emotion recognition, and user intent control. These advancements have broader implications for enhancing human well-being by expanding access to brain–computer interface (BCI) technologies and enabling more diverse real-world applications. While our method is primarily developed for foundation models (FMs), it is designed to leverage key EEG characteristics, making it also adaptable to task- and setup-specific models for a wide range of application-specific scenarios. Furthermore, our findings provide valuable insights for the development of more advanced foundation models that incorporate other EEG-specific characteristics, such as brain connectivity.

- F.3 Potential Misuse

As EEG foundation models become increasingly powerful for healthcare and brain–computer interface (BCI) applications, it is crucial to acknowledge their potential for misuse, for example, unauthorized cognitive surveillance or profiling. The ability to infer mental states or cognitive intent, if applied without proper oversight, raises profound ethical concerns. Addressing these risks will require the development of neurotechnology regulations, data protection policies, and ethics frameworks to ensure responsible use and safeguard individual neural privacy.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

###### 1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: Double checked carefully. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper.
- • The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.
- • The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.
- • It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.

###### 2. Limitations Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: It is provided in the Appendix Section F.1. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
- • The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
- • The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
- • The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
- • The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
- • The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
- • If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
- • While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

###### 3. Theory assumptions and proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: This work does not make theoretical assumptions. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
- • All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and crossreferenced.
- • All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
- • The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
- • Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
- • Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

###### 4. Experimental result reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: The information is detailed in Section 3 and Appendix D with source code provided. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- • If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
- • If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
- • Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
- • While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example

- (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.
- (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
- (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
- (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

###### 5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide our project link in the Abstract, which includes the source code and instructions. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
- • Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/ public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
- • While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
- • The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https: //nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
- • The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
- • The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
- • At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
- • Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

###### 6. Experimental setting/details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: It is detailed in Section 3. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- • The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
- • The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.

###### 7. Experiment statistical significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: The numerical results are provided. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- • The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
- • The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
- • The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
- • The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

- • It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
- • It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
- • For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
- • If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

###### 8. Experiments compute resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: It is in Section 3 and Appendix D. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
- • The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
- • The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
- • The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn’t make it into the paper).

###### 9. Code of ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: Yes, we followed it. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
- • If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics.
- • The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

###### 10. Broader impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: It is in Appendix F.2. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
- • If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
- • Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

- • The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
- • The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
- • If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

###### 11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA] Justification: Our work does not involve the described risk. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
- • Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
- • Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
- • We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

###### 12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: We are the original owners of our assets. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
- • The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
- • The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
- • The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
- • For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.
- • If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
- • For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

- • If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset’s creators.

###### 13. New assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: The code is well documented. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
- • Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
- • The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
- • At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

###### 14. Crowdsourcing and research with human subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA] Justification: Not relevant to our work. Guidelines:

- • The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
- • Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
- • According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.

###### 15. Institutional review board (IRB) approvals or equivalent for research with human subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?
