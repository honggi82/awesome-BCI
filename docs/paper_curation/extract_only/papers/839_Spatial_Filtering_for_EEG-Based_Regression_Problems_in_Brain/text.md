Abstract—Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are frequently
used in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), but they are easily
contaminated by artifacts and noises, so preprocessing must be
done before they are fed into a machine learning algorithm
for classiﬁcation or regression. Spatial ﬁlters have been widely
used to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of EEG for BCI
classiﬁcation problems, but their applications in BCI regression
problems have been very limited. This paper proposes two
common spatial pattern (CSP) ﬁlters for EEG-based regression
problems in BCI, which are extended from the CSP ﬁlter for
classiﬁcation, by making use of fuzzy sets. Experimental results
on EEG-based response speed estimation from a large-scale study,
which collected 143 sessions of sustained-attention psychomotor
vigilance task data from 17 subjects during a 5-month period,
demonstrate that the two proposed spatial ﬁlters can signiﬁcantly
increase the EEG signal quality. When used in LASSO and k-
nearest neighbors regression for user response speed estimation,
the spatial ﬁlters can reduce the root mean square estimation
error by 10.02 −19.77%, and at the same time increase the
correlation to the true response speed by 19.39 −86.47%.

I. INTRODUCTION
Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are the most widely
used input for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) [24], [25],
[29], [34], [47], [53], mainly due to the convenience to obtain
them, compared with magnetoencephalography (MEG) [32],
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) [44], func-
tional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) [33], and invasive
signals like electrocorticography (ECoG) [35] and intracortical
neural recordings [30]. However, EEG signals are often con-
taminated by ocular, muscular, and cardiac artifacts and vari-
ous noises (power-line, changes in electrode impedances, etc)
[4], [34], [49]. Usually some preprocessing, either manually or
automatically [4], [34], is needed to remove the artifacts, and
then temporal and spatial ﬁlters are applied to further improve
the EEG signal quality before feeding it into a classiﬁcation
or regression algorithm. The most commonly used temporal
ﬁlters are band-pass ﬁlters and notch ﬁlters (at 50 or 60 Hz
power-line frequency).
This paper focuses on spatial ﬁltering for improving the
EEG signal quality. Many such approaches have been proposed
in the literature [2], [7], [15], [17], [37], [38], [40], [41],
[54]. However, almost all of them focus primarily on EEG
classiﬁcation problems in BCI, whereas EEG regression prob-
lems have been largely overlooked. Nevertheless, the latter is
also very important in BCI. One example is driver drowsiness
(or alertness) estimation from EEG signals, which has been
extensively studied in our previous research [26]–[28], [56],
[59], [60], [62]. This is a very important problem because
drowsy driving is among the most important causes of road
crashes, following only to alcohol, speeding, and inattention
[43]. According to the National Highway Trafﬁc Safety Ad-
ministration [52], 2.5% of fatal motor vehicle crashes (on
average 886/year in the U.S.) and 2.5% of fatalities (on average
1,004/year in the U.S.) between 2005 and 2009 involved
drowsy driving.
This paper proposes two spatial ﬁlters for EEG-based re-
gression problems in BCI. We also validate their performance
in response speed (RS) estimation from EEG signals measured
in a large-scale sustained-attention psychomotor vigilance task
(PVT) [21], which collected 143 sessions of data from 17
subjects in a 5-month period.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Sec-
tion II reviews the state-of-the-art spatial ﬁlters for EEG-
based classiﬁcation problems in BCI. Section III introduces
our proposed spatial ﬁlters for supervised BCI regression
problems. Section IV describes the experimental setup, RS
and EEG data preprocessing techniques, and the procedure to
evaluate the performances of different spatial ﬁlters. Section V
presents the results of the comparative studies and parameter
sensitivity analysis for the proposed spatial ﬁlter. Section VI
discusses the limitations of the proposed approaches and
outlines several future research directions. Finally, Section VII

draws conclusions.
II. SPATIAL FILTERS FOR EEG CLASSIFICATION IN BCI
Many spatial ﬁlters have been proposed for EEG classiﬁca-
tion in BCI. The most basic ones include common average
reference (CAR) [48], Laplacian ﬁlters [23], and principal
component analysis [19]. Some of the more recent and also
more sophisticated ones are:
1) Independent Component Analysis (ICA) [9], [17], [54],
which decomposes a multivariate signal into indepen-
dent non-Gaussian signals. ICA has been widely used
in the EEG research community to detect and remove
stereotyped eye, muscle, and line noise artifacts [20],
[26], [49].
Generally ICA works on an unepoched long block of
EEG data, instead of epoched short EEG trials. Let the
unepoched EEG data be X ∈RC×T , where C is the
number of EEG channels, and T is the number of time
samples. ICA assumes that X is the linear combination
of c independent sources, i.e., X = AS, where A ∈
RC×c is the mixing matrix, and the source signals, which
are the rows of S ∈Rc×T , are supposed to be stationary,
independent, and non-Gaussian. ICA can use various
different principles [9], [17], [49], [54] to estimate both
unknown A and unknown S simultaneously from X.
Once S is obtained, cleaner and more representative
features may be extracted from it than from the original
X [26].
2) xDAWN algorithm [38]–[40], which is often used to
increase the signal to signal-plus-noise ratio in P300-
based BCIs.
Like ICA, xDAWN also works on the unepoched long
block of EEG data X ∈RC×T . It assumes that X =
PDT +N, where P ∈RC×S represents the P300 signal
in an EEG epoch, and D ∈RT ×S is a Toeplitz matrix
whose ﬁrst column is deﬁned as:
Dτk,1 =



1,
τk is the onset of the
kth target stimulus
0,
otherwise
(1)
and N ∈RC×T represents the ongoing background
brain activity as well as the artifacts and noises. xDAWN
then designs a spatial ﬁltering matrix W∗∈RC×F,
where F is the number of spatial ﬁlters, to maximize
the signal to signal-plus-noise ratio, i.e.,
W∗= arg max
W
Tr(WT PDT DPT W)
Tr(WT XXT W)
(2)
where Tr(·) is the trace of a matrix. (2) is a generalized
Rayleigh quotient [14], and its solution W∗is the con-
catenation of the F eigenvectors associated with the F
largest eigenvalues of the matrix (XXT )−1PDT DPT .
The spatially ﬁltered trial for Xn is then computed as:
X′
n = W∗T Xn,
n = 1, ..., N.
(3)
3) Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) [15], [41], which
ﬁnds linear transformations to maximize the correlations
between two datasets. It has been used to improve BCI
performance in code-modulated visual evoked potentials
[5], steady-state visual evoked potentials [6], and event-
related potentials like P300 and error-related potentials
[45].
Unlike ICA and xDAWN, CCA works on epoched EEG
trials. Consider a binary classiﬁcation problem, with N1
training examples in Class 1 and N2 training examples in
Class 2. Let (Xn, yn) be the nth training example, where
Xn ∈RC×S (C is the number of channels, and S is the
number of time samples in each trial), and yn ∈{1, 2}.
Let ¯Xk ∈RC×S be the average of Xn in Class k (k =
1, 2). We then construct ˜X = [ ˜X1 ˜X2] and ˜Z = [˜Z1 ˜Z2],
where ˜Xk is the concatenation of all Nk Xn in Class k,
and ˜Zk is the concatenation of Nk ¯Xk. CCA ﬁrst ﬁnds
two vector ﬁlters w ˜X and w˜Z such that the correlation
between wT
˜X ˜X and wT
˜Z ˜Z is maximized. wT
˜XX and wT
˜Z ˜Z
are called the ﬁrst pair of canonical variables. CCA then
ﬁnds the second pair of canonical variables in a similar
way, subject to the constraint that they are uncorrelated
with the ﬁrst pair of canonical variables. This procedure
can be continued up to C times.
Finally, the spatial ﬁltering matrix is the concatenation
of all w ˜X, which can be applied to each Xn to increase
its SNR.
4) Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) [7], [37], which is a su-
pervised technique frequently used to enhance the binary
classiﬁcation performance of EEG data. The basic idea is
to separate the EEG signal into additive subcomponents
which have maximum differences in variance between
the two classes. In the following we introduce the
one-versus-the-rest (OVR) CSP [11], which extends the
traditional CSP from binary classiﬁcation to K classes.
Like CCA, OVR CSP also works on epoched EEG trials.
Let (Xn, yn) be the nth training example, as deﬁned
above. Assume the mean of Xn has been removed, e.g.,
by high-pass or band-pass ﬁltering. Then, for Class k,
OVR CSP ﬁnds a spatial ﬁlter matrix W∗
k ∈RC×F ,
where F is the number of spatial ﬁlters, to maximize
the variance difference between Class k and the rest:
W∗
k = arg max
W
Tr(WT ¯ΣkW)
Tr[WT (P
i̸=k ¯Σi)W]
(4)
where ¯Σk is the mean covariance matrix of trials in
Class k. (4) is also a generalized Rayleigh quotient
[14], and the solution W∗
k is the concatenation of the F
eigenvectors associated with the F largest eigenvalues
of the matrix (P
i̸=k ¯Σi)−1 ¯Σk.
Finally, we concatenate the K individual OVR CSP
spatial ﬁlters to obtain the complete ﬁlter:
W∗= [W∗
1, ... W∗
K] ∈RC×KF
(5)
and compute the spatially ﬁltered trial for Xn by (3).
III. SPATIAL FILTERS FOR SUPERVISED BCI REGRESSION
PROBLEMS
In this section we propose two common spatial pattern for
regression (CSPR) ﬁlters, which extend the multi-class CSP

3
ﬁlters from classiﬁcation to regression by making use of fuzzy
sets [63], as we have done in [62].
First, a brief introduction of fuzzy sets is given below.
A. Fuzzy Sets
A fuzzy set A is comprised of a universe of discourse DA
of real numbers together with a membership function µA :
DA →[0, 1], i.e.,
A =
Z
DA
µA(x)/x
(6)
Here
R
denotes the collection of all points x ∈DA with
associated membership degree µA(x). An example of a fuzzy
set is shown in Fig. 1. The membership degrees are µA(1) = 0,
µA(3) = 0.5, µA(5) = 1, µA(6) = 0.8, and µA(10) = 0.
Observe that this is different from traditional (binary) sets,
where each element can only belong to a set completely (i.e.,
with membership degree 1), or does not belong to it at all
(i.e., with membership degree 0); there is nothing in between
(i.e., with membership degree 0.5). Fuzzy sets are frequently
used in modeling concepts in natural language [22], [36], [55],
which may not have clear boundaries.
Fig. 1.
An examples of a fuzzy set.
B. CSPR-OVR
Let Xn ∈RC×S (n = 1, ..., N) be the nth EEG trial, where
C is the number of channels and S is the number of time
samples in each trial. We assume that the mean of each channel
measurement has been removed, which is usually performed
by band-pass ﬁltering. Let yn ∈{1, ..., K} be the RS of Xn.
With the help of fuzzy sets, we can deﬁne “fuzzy” classes
to connect regression problems and classiﬁcation problems.
Assume K fuzzy classes are used. First, we partition the
interval [0, 100] into K + 1 equal intervals, and denote the
partition points as {pk}k=1,...,K. It is easy to obtain that
pk = 100 · k
K + 1 ,
k = 1, ..., K
(7)
For each pk, we then ﬁnd the corresponding pk percentile
value of all training yn and denote it as Pk. Next we deﬁne
K fuzzy classes from them, as shown in Fig. 2. In this way,
we can “classify” the training yn into K fuzzy classes, corre-
sponding to the K crisp classes in the CSP for classiﬁcation.
However, note that in the CSP for classiﬁcation a yn belongs
to a crisp class either completely or not at all. For a fuzzy
class here, a yn can belong to it at a membership degree in
[0, 1].
Fig. 2.
The K fuzzy classes for yn, when triangular fuzzy sets are used.
Next, for each fuzzy class, we compute its mean EEG trial
as:
¯Xk =
PN
n=1 µk(yn)Xn
PN
n=1 µk(yn)
,
k = 1, ..., K
(8)
where µk(yn) is the membership degree of yn in Fuzzy Class
k. Substituting (8) into (4), we can solve for the spatial ﬁltering
matrix W∗
k for Fuzzy Class k. Essentially, this W∗
k makes
those Xn in Fuzzy Class k different from those not in Fuzzy
Class k, which will help the regression performance, as we
will demonstrate in Section V.
Next, we construct the concatenated spatial ﬁltering matrix
W∗by (5), and ﬁnally perform the spatial ﬁltering for each
EEG trial Xn by (3). The complete CSPR-OVR spatial ﬁlter
for supervised BCI regression problems is summarized in
Algorithm 1.
Algorithm 1: The CSPR-OVR spatial ﬁlter for supervised
BCI regression problems.
Input: EEG training examples (Xn, yn), where
Xn ∈RC×S, n = 1, ..., N;
K, the number of fuzzy classes for yn;
F, the number of spatial ﬁlters for each
fuzzy class.
Output: Spatially ﬁltered EEG trials X′
n ∈RKF ×S.
Band-pass ﬁlter each Xn to remove the mean of each
channel;
Compute {pk}k=1,...,K in (7);
Compute the corresponding percentile values

Construct the K fuzzy classes as shown in Fig. 2;
Compute ¯Xk by (8);
Compute W∗
k by (4);
Construct W∗by (5);
Return X′
n by (3)
C. CSPR-OVA
In (4) we construct the multi-class CSP using an OVR
approach, but it can also be constructed using the following
one-versus-all (OVA) approach:
W∗
k = arg max
W
Tr(WT ¯ΣkW)
Tr[WT (PK
i=1 ¯Σi)W]
(9)

4
The only difference between (9) and (4) is that the numerator
of (9) also includes the contribution from Class k itself. If we
view Class k as the signal of interest, and all other classes
as noises, then (9) maximizes the signal to signal-plus-noise
ratio, as (2) in the xDAWN algorithm.
Equation (9) is also a generalized Rayleigh quotient [14],
and the solution W∗
k is the concatenation of the F eigenvec-
tors associated with the F largest eigenvalues of the matrix
(PK
i=1 ¯Σi)−1 ¯Σk. The OVA CSP for classiﬁcation still uses
(5) to construct the ﬁnal spatial ﬁlter, and (3) to perform the
ﬁltering.
Using the technique introduced in the previous subsection,
we can easily develop the CSPR-OVA spatial ﬁlter for BCI
regression problems. Its procedure is almost identical to that
in Algorithm 1. The only difference is that W∗
k is computed
by (9) instead of (4).
IV. EXPERIMENTS AND DATA
This section introduces a PVT experiment that was used
to evaluate the performances of the proposed spatial ﬁltering
algorithms, the corresponding RS and EEG data preprocessing
procedures, and the feature sets.
A. Experiment Setup
17 university students (13 males; average age 22.4, standard
deviation 1.6) from National Chiao Tung University (NCTU)
in Taiwan volunteered to support the data-collection efforts
over a 5-month period to study EEG correlates of attention
and performance changes under speciﬁc conditions of real-
world fatigue [21], as determined by the effectiveness score
of Readiband [42]. The voluntary, fully informed consent of
the persons used in this research was obtained as required
by federal and Army regulations [50], [51]. The Institutional
Review Board of NCTU approved the experimental protocol.
All participants registered their fatigue levels through a
smartphone daily, and received notiﬁcations to report for
experimental trials when the effectiveness score deemed their
conditions ﬁtted the experimental requirement (low fatigue:
> 90; normal: [70, 90]; high fatigue: < 70). Upon completion
of the related questionnaires [Karolinska Sleepiness Scale
(KSS) [1], and electronically-adapted visual analog scale for
fatigue (VAS-F) and stress (VAS-S)] and the informed consent
form, subjects performed a PVT, a dynamic attention-shifting
task, a lane-keeping task, and selected surveys (KSS, VAS-
F, VAS-S, state-trait anxiety inventory, and mind-wandering)
preceding each condition. EEG data were recorded at 1000
Hz using a 64-channel NeuroScan system. Most participants
performed the laboratory experiment thrice in each of the three
fatigue states.
In this paper we focus on the PVT [10], which is a
sustained-attention task that uses RS to measure the speed with
which a subject responds to a visual stimulus. It is widely
used, particularly by NASA, for its ease of scoring, simple
metrics, convergent validity, and free of learning effects. In
our experiment, the PVT was presented on a smartphone with
each trial initiated as an empty solid white circle centered
on the touchscreen that began to ﬁll in red displayed as a
clockwise sweeping motion like the hand of a clock. The
sweeping motion was programmed to turn solid red in one
second or terminate upon a response by the participants, which
required them to tap the touchscreen with the thumb of their
dominant hand. The RS was computed as the inverse of the
elapsed time between the appearance of the empty solid white
circle and the participant’s response. Following completion of
each trial, the circle went back to solid white until the next
trial. Inter-trial intervals consisted of random intervals between
2-10 seconds.
143 sessions of PVT data were collected from the 17
subjects, and each session lasted 10 minutes. Our goal is to
predict the RS using a 3-second EEG trial immediately before
it.
B. Performance Evaluation Process
The following procedure was performed to evaluate the
performances of different spatial ﬁlters:
1) EEG data preprocessing to suppress artifacts and noises.
2) RS data preprocessing to suppress outliers.
3) 5-fold cross-validation to compute the regression per-
formance for each combination of spatial ﬁlters and
regression method: ﬁrst randomly partition the trials
into ﬁve equal folds; then, use four folds for super-
vised spatial ﬁltering and regression model training, and
the remaining fold for testing; repeat this ﬁve times
so that every fold is used in testing; ﬁnally compute
the regression performances in terms of root mean
square error (RMSE) and correlation coefﬁcient (CC).
Two regression methods were used: LASSO, whose
adjustable parameter λ was optimized by an inner 5-fold
cross-validation on the training dataset, and k-nearest
neighbors (kNN) regression, where k = 5.
4) Repeat Step 3 10 times and compute the average regres-
sion performance.
More details about the ﬁrst two steps are given in the next
two subsections.
C. EEG Data Preprocessing
We ﬁrst downsampled the EEG data to 256 Hz, then
epoched them to 3-second trials according to the onset of the
PVTs. Let the onset time of the nth PVT be tn. Then, the 62-
channel EEG trial in [tn −3, tn] seconds was used to predict
the RS, i.e., Xn ∈R62×768. Each trial was then individually
ﬁltered by a [1, 20] Hz ﬁnite impulse response band-pass ﬁlter
to make each channel zero-mean and to remove un-useful high
frequency components.
Because the inter-trial intervals consisted of random inter-
vals between 2-10 seconds, it’s possible that a 3-second EEG
trial covers part of data from the previous trial. Additionally,
a trial may also contain the EEG oscillations related to motor
reaction (tapping the touchscreen) in the previous trial. To
remedy these problems, we removed overlapping trials: let the
RS of the nth trial be yn (the corresponding response time is
1/yn); then, the nth trial is removed if tn−tn−1 < 1/yn−1+3,
i.e., when the 3-second EEG data for Trial n overlap with the
data and response for the previous trial.

D. RS Data Preprocessing
The raw response times for two subjects are shown in Fig. 3.
The top panel is from a typical subject, whose response times
were mostly shorter than 1 second. The lower panel is from
a subject with possible data recording issues, because lots
of response times were longer than 5 seconds, which are
highly unlikely in practice. So we excluded that subject from
consideration in this paper, and only used the remaining 16
subjects.

Response times for a typical subject (top panel) and a subject with

and the red stars are response times above the threshold, which will be brought
to the threshold.
As shown in Fig. 3, the response times were very noisy, and
there were obvious outliers. It is very important to suppress
the outliers and noises so that the performances of different
algorithms can be more accurately compared. In addition to the
step in the previous subsection to remove overlapping trials,
we also employed the following 2-step procedure for response
time preprocessing:
1) Outlier thresholding, which aimed to suppress abnor-
mally large response times. First, a threshold θ =
my + 3σy was computed for each subject, where my is
the mean response time from all sessions of that subject,
and σy is the corresponding standard deviation. Then, all
response times larger than θ were replaced by θ. Note
that the threshold was different for different subjects.
2) Moving average smoothing, which replaced each re-
sponse time by the average response time during a 60
seconds moving window centered at the onset of the
corresponding PVT to suppress noises.
We then computed the RS as the inverse of the RT. The
RSs for the 16 subjects are shown in Fig. 4. Observe that
they are roughly in the same range, and many of them are
approximately Gaussian.
E. Feature Extraction
We extracted the following four feature sets for each pre-
processed EEG trial:
• Raw: Theta and Alpha powerband features from the band-
pass ﬁltered EEG trials. We computed the average power
spectral density (PSD) in the Theta band (4-8 Hz) and
Alpha band (8-13 Hz) for each channel using Welch’s

method [57], and converted these 62 × 2 = 124 band
powers to dBs as our features.
• CAR: Theta and Alpha powerband features from EEG
trials ﬁltered by CAR. This procedure was almost iden-
tical to Raw, except that the band-pass ﬁltered EEG
trials were also spatially ﬁltered by CAR before the
62 × 2 = 124 powerband features were computed. CAR
is one of the most commonly used spatial ﬁlters for EEG,
and [31] showed that it helped improve EEG classiﬁcation
performance. It simply removes the mean of all channels
from each channel.
• OVR: Theta and Alpha powerband features from EEG
trials ﬁltered by CSPR-OVR. This procedure was almost
identical to CAR, except that the CAR ﬁlter was replaced
by CSPR-OVR. We used 3 fuzzy classes for the RSs,
and 21 spatial ﬁlters1 for each fuzzy class, so that the
spatially ﬁltered signals had dimensionality 63 × 1280,
roughly the same as the dimensionality of the original
signals. We then extracted 63 × 2 = 126 band power
features for each trial.
• OVA: Theta and Alpha powerband features from EEG
trials ﬁltered by CSPR-OVA. This procedure was also
almost identical to CAR, except that the spatial ﬁltering
was performed by CSPR-OVA instead of CAR. There
were also 63 × 2 = 126 band power features for each
trial.
V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
This section compares the informativeness of the features
in Raw, CAR, OVR and OVA, presents the regression perfor-
mances, and also performs parameter sensitivity analysis for
Algorithm 1.
1We used 21 spatial ﬁlters here so that the ﬁltered signals had roughly the
same dimensionality as the original signals, which ensured fair performance
comparison. In Section V-C we also performed sensitivity analysis on the
number of spatial ﬁlters.

A. Informativeness of the Features
Before studying the regression performances, it is important
to check if the extracted features in Raw, CAR, OVR and OVA
are indeed meaningful. We picked a typical subject, partitioned
his data random into 50% training and 50% testing, and
extracted Raw and CAR. We then designed the spatial ﬁlters
using CSPR-OVR and CSPR-OVA on the training data, and
extracted the corresponding OVR and OVA. For each feature
set, we identiﬁed the top three channels that had the maximum
correlation with the RS using the training data, and also
computed the corresponding correlation coefﬁcients for the
testing data.
The results are shown in Fig. 5, where in each subﬁgure
the data on the left of the black dotted line were used for
training, and the right for testing. The top thick curve is the
RS, and the bottom three curves are the maximally correlated
features (note that good features are negatively correlated with
the RS) identiﬁed from the training data. The training and
testing correlation coefﬁcients are shown on the left and right
of the corresponding channel, respectively. Observe that the
features from CAR had slightly better correlations with the RS
in training than those from Raw, but not necessarily in testing.
However, the features from OVR and OVA had much higher
training and testing correlations to the RS than those from
Raw and CAR, suggesting that CSPR-OVR and CSPR-OVA
can indeed increase the signal quality. The reason is: if we
view Class k as the signal of interest, and all other classes as
noises, then CSPR-OVR in (4) enhances the signal to noise
ratio of the EEG signal, and CSPR-OVA in (9) enhances the
signal to signal-plus-noise ratio.

B. Regression Performance Comparison
The RMSEs and CCs of LASSO and kNN using the four
feature sets are shown in Fig. 6 for the 16 subjects. Recall that
for each subject the feature extraction methods were run 10
times, each with randomly partitioned training and testing data,
and the average regression performances are shown here. The
average RMSEs and CCs across all subjects are also shown in
the last group of each panel. Observe that CAR had comparable
or slightly better performance than Raw. Regardless of which
regression algorithm was used, generally OVR and OVA had
similar performance, and both of them achieved much smaller
RMSEs and much larger CCs than Raw and CAR, suggesting
that our extension of CSP from supervised classiﬁcation to
supervised regression can indeed improve the regression per-
formance. Finally, LASSO had better performance than kNN
on Raw and CAR, but kNN became better on OVR and OVA.
The corresponding percentage performance improvements
of LASSO and kNN using the four feature sets are shown
in Fig. 7, where the legend “LASSO,OVR/Raw” means the
percentage performance improvement of LASSO on OVR over
LASSO on Raw, and other legends should be interpreted in
a similar manner. For both LASSO and kNN, OVR and OVA
achieved similar performance improvements over Raw, and
also over CAR. For LASSO, on average OVR had 10.02%
smaller RMSE than Raw, and 19.39% larger CC. For kNN,
on average OVR had 19.77% smaller RMSE than Raw, and
86.47% larger CC.
We also performed a two-way Analysis of Variance
(ANOVA) for different regression algorithms to check if the
RMSE and CC differences among the four feature sets were
statistically signiﬁcant, by setting the subjects as a random
effect. The results are shown in Table I, which indicated that
there were statistically signiﬁcant differences in both RMSEs
and CCs among different feature sets for both LASSO and
kNN.

Then, non-parametric multiple comparison tests based on
Dunn’s procedure [12], [13] were used to determine if the
difference between any pair of algorithms was statistically
signiﬁcant, with a p-value correction using the False Discovery
Rate method [3]. The p-values are shown in Table II, where
the statistically signiﬁcant ones are marked in bold. Table II
shows that, except for the CC of kNN, generally there was
no statistically signiﬁcant difference between Raw and CAR.
However, for both LASSO and kNN, the RMSE and CC
differences between {OVR, OVA} and {Raw, CAR} were
always statistically signiﬁcant. In all cases, there were no
statistically signiﬁcant differences between OVR and OVA.

C. Parameter Sensitivity Analysis
There are two adjustable parameters in CSPR-OVR: K, the
number of fuzzy classes for the RSs, and F, the number
of spatial ﬁlters for each fuzzy class. In this subsection we
study the sensitivity of the regression performance to these
two parameters.
The regression performances for K = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} (F
was ﬁxed to be 21) are shown in Fig. 8. Algorithm 1 was
repeated ﬁve times, each with a random partition of training
and testing data, and the average regression results are shown.
For both LASSO and kNN, on average K = 2 gave worst
performance, but K = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7} resulted in roughly the
same RMSE and CC. Hence, K = 3 seems to be a good
compromise between performance and computational cost.
The

performances
for
F
=
{5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60} (K was ﬁxed to be 3) are shown in
Fig. 9. Algorithm 1 was again repeated ﬁve times, and the
average regression results are shown. For both LASSO and
kNN, generally a larger F resulted in a smaller RMSE and
a larger CC, but the performance may reach a plateau at a
certain F. Also, a larger F means heavier computational cost,
which should be taken into consideration in choosing F. For
the PVT experiment, F ∈[20, 30] seemed to achieve a good
compromise between performance and computational cost.
D. Different Fuzzy Set Shapes
In Section III we used triangular fuzzy sets for simplicity,
but other shapes can also be used. Fig. 10 illustrates how
Gaussian fuzzy sets can be designed here: the center of the
kth Gaussian fuzzy class is at Pk [computed from (7)], and

the spread is specially designed so that two adjacent fuzzy
sets intersect at the midpoint with membership grade 0.5. As a
result, generally the Gaussian fuzzy classes are not symmetric.
When the Gaussian fuzzy classes in Fig. 10 are used in
CSPR-OVR and CSPR-OVA, the results are shown in Fig. 11,
which are almost identical to those obtained from triangular
fuzzy sets (Fig. 6).

E. Robustness to Noise
It is also important to study the robustness of different
spatial ﬁlters to noises. According to [64], there are two types
of noises: class noise, which is the noise on the model outputs,
and attribute noise, which is the noise on the model inputs.
In this subsection we focus on the attribute noise.
As in [64], for each model input, we randomly replaced q%
(q = 0, 10, ..., 40) of all trials from a subject with a uniform
noise between its minimum and maximum values. After this
was done for both the training and testing data, we extracted
feature sets Raw, CAR, OVR and OVA, and trained LASSO
and kNN, on the corrupted training data. We then tested their
performances on the corrupted testing data. The results are
shown in Fig. 12. Generally, as the noise level increased, the
performances decreased, which is intuitive. However, OVR and
OVA achieved better RMSEs and CCs than Raw and CAR at
almost all noise levels, suggesting that it is still beneﬁcial
to use CSPR-OVR and CSPR-OVA even under high attribute
noise.

is done, the ﬁltering of new EEG trials can be conducted very
efﬁciently by a simple matrix multiplication [see (3)]. Let N
be the number of training samples. Then, the actual training
time of CSPR-OVR and CSPR-OVA increased linearly with
N, as shown in Fig. 13. The platform was a Dell XPS15 laptop
(Intel i7-6700HQ CPU @2.60GHz, 16 GB memory) running
Windows 10 Pro 64-bit and Matlab 2016b. A least squares
curve ﬁt shows that the training time is 0.2216 + 0.0003N
seconds, which should not be a problem for a practical N.

VI. DISCUSSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH
Recall that 5-fold cross-validation was used in the perfor-
mance evaluation in the previous section, i.e., we concate-
nated the nine-session data from the same subject, randomly
partitioned them into ﬁve equal-length folds, and then used
four folds for training and the remaining one for testing. So,
the training and testing folds contained data from the same
sessions. This is equivalent to the case that we label some
session-speciﬁc data in ofﬂine regression. Our results showed
that in this case CSPR-OVR and CSPR-OVA can signiﬁcantly
improve the regression performance.
To avoid the use of session-speciﬁc data, we also inves-
tigated a different validation method: leave-one-session-out
validation, in which for each subject we trained the spatial
ﬁlters using eight sessions and tested them on the remaining
session. Interestingly, all four feature sets and both regression
models achieved very poor performance here. The reasons are:
1) we need a proper way to normalize the RSs from different
sessions, as done for the response times in [16]; and, 2) there is
large intra-subject variation, meaning that the EEG responses
for the same subject vary at different times (recall that these
nine sessions were collected at different days); so, the pat-
terns learned from previous sessions become obsolete for the
new session, and hence spatial ﬁltering alone does not help.
However, our previous research [58], [61], [62] has shown that
transfer learning can cope well with the inter-subject variation
(individual differences) in both classiﬁcation and regression
problems, and we conjecture that it can also handle the intra-
subject variation. One of our future research directions is to
demonstrate the performance of CSPR-OVR and CSPR-OVA
in a transfer learning framework to individualize a generalized
model for regression problems, as done in [18], [46] for EEG-
based cognitive performance classiﬁcation.
Another direction of our future research will apply CSPR-
OVR and CSPR-OVA to other important EEG-based regres-
sion problems, e.g., drowsiness (or alertness) estimation during
driving, and integrate it with more sophisticated feature ex-
traction approaches, e.g., Riemannian geometry [8], for better
regression performance.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
EEG signals are easily contaminated by artifacts and noises,
so preprocessing is needed before they are fed into a machine
learning algorithm in BCI. Spatial ﬁlters, e.g., ICA, xDAWN,
CSP and CCA, have been widely used to increase the EEG
signal quality for classiﬁcation problems, but their applications
in BCI regression problems have been very limited. In this
paper, we have proposed two CSP ﬁlters for EEG-based re-
gression problems in BCI, which were extended from the CSP
ﬁlter for classiﬁcation, by making use of fuzzy sets. Extensive
experimental results on EEG-based RS estimation from a
large-scale study, which collected 143 sessions of PVT data
from 17 subjects during a 5-month period, demonstrated that
our proposed spatial ﬁlters can signiﬁcantly increase the EEG
signal quality. When used in LASSO and kNN, the spatial
ﬁlters can reduce the estimation RMSE by 10.02 −19.77%,
and at the same time increase the CC by 19.39 −86.47%.
